## Idea for the logo
- It raises the (a) question, the answer has to be given (by us)
- The hexagon equals a window to be opened
- The two variants might be used by purpose: the “logo” as explanation and the icon as insider 
- The suggested function is stupid, but could be a gimmick:
	- is.ssL(ARchaeology)  
	 TRUE    
	 FALSE
- set LAR in upper case
	- Language = dialogue, information, knowledge
	- Archaeology = our topic
	- R = our or a good or the dominant :-) framework

The grafik has to developed a bit more...
